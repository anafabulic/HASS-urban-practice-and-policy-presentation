						<h3>tl;dr</h3>
						<p>
							Experts usually cite Singapore&rsquo;s <em>unique spatial constraints</em> and <em>political situation</em> as reasons for Singapore&rsquo;s transport policy success.
						</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-in">
							<small>(these are usually treated as historical and geographical &lsquo;givens&rsquo;)</small>
						</p>
						<p>
							&darr;
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>but...</h3>
						<p>...the so-called <em>unique political landscape</em> includes lots of internal and external frictions.</p>
						<p>
							&darr;
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>and so...</h3>
						<p>it&rsquo;s more accurate to credit Singapore&rsquo;s transport policy successes to the PAP invoking these &lsquo;given facts&rsquo; in order to <em>produce new, streamlined consensuses</em> in Parliament.</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>what I did:</h3>
					<p>
						Trawled through 55 years of Parliament transcripts and NewspaperSG archives for mentions of &lsquo;mobility&rsquo;, &lsquo;public transport&rsquo;, &lsquo;congestion&rsquo;, etc.
					</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-in">
						<small>(basically looking @ mobility through terrestrial, motorised transport&mdash;that&rsquo;s the kind most-discussed in Parliament when it comes to spending and building things)</small>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<div>
						<h5>history</h5>
						<p><em>1955:</em> Fear of gridlock drives planning urgency.</p>
						<p><em>mid&ndash;1960s:</em> Transport planning takes a backseat during drama of merger and separation with Malaysia.</p>
						<p><em>1970:</em> Minister of Communication <em>Yong Nyuk Lin</em> sets transport White Paper characterised by firm-minded rationalisation of bus services. </p>
					</div>
					<div class="fragment fade-in ">
						<h5 class="r-fit-text">this sets a precedent for firm measures as <br> &lsquo;<em>the only rational alternative</em>&rsquo; in a congested city. </h5>
					</div>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h4 class="r-fit-text"><em>3</em> main threads</h4>
						<h5>&darr;</h5>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>1:</h3>
						<p><em>MRT too expensive</em>&mdash;debated between Goh Keng Swee and Ong Teng Cheong in Parliament circa 1981.</p>
						<p>Between the late &lsquo;60s and early &lsquo;70s, various <em>backbenchers</em> also raised issues of cost of appraisals vs. perceived slowness of construction.</p>
						<p>Consensus gradually forged through <em>technological necessity</em> and <em>futuristic/world-city imaginaries</em>.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>2:</h3>
						<p><em>Curbs on car ownership and use</em> met with dissent and requests for clarifications starting in the mid&ndash;&lsquo;70s.</p>
						<p>Mid&ndash;&lsquo;90s dissent raised by opposition <em>SDP</em> crushed by the PAP&rsquo;s superior facts and figures.</p>
						<p>The <em>Electronic Road Pricing</em> programme rolls out practically uncontested.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>3:</h3>
						<p>The theme of <em>climate change</em> is tepidly raised in Parliament from the early &lsquo;00s, only really gaining steam in 2022 post&ndash;COP26.</p>
						<p>In the meantime, transport policy <em>shies away</em> from punitive measures and becomes <em>more aspirational</em> rather than necessary.</p>
						<p>Consensus is tenuous as sustainability is <em>not a unilateral</em> affair.</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>so we see:</h3>
					<p>The PAP justified sweeping transport reform and punitive measures with the spectre of congestion and the necessity of high-technology.</p>
					<p><em>Dissent</em> was quashed and <em>consensus</em> was forged by invoking the need for technocratic measures in desperate times.</p>
					<p>Beginning with the MRT, <em>consensus</em> was forged by invoking aspirational imaginaries.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>We don&rsquo;t see such a cohesive push towards green mobility.<span class="fragment fade-in">.. yet?</span></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>my (cynical, unfounded) take:</h4>
					<p>Need about <em>20 years</em> to get over organisational inertia (&lsquo;60s&ndash;&lsquo;80s for MRT, &lsquo;70s&ndash;&lsquo;90s for ERP).</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-in">We&rsquo;ll get there by setting goals between <em>2030&ndash;2050</em>.</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-in">But is it <em>too late</em>?</p>
				</section>
				<section class="data-auto-animate">
					<h4>conclusion:</h4>
					<p>What is certain is that the <em>old ways</em> of generating consensus (desperation, technocratic rationality, global-city excellence) will rear their heads in <em>new forms</em>.</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-in"><small>(but softening stances towards unilateral action and punitive measures suggest that different outcomes will follow.)</small></p>
				</section>
				<section class="data-auto-animate">
					<h3>conclusion:</h3>
					<p>don&rsquo;t credit policy success to predestined givens&mdash;look at where dissent happened & see how it was paved over</p>
